Divvying Up

A solid competitive programming team can rack up a lot of prize money. Knowing
how strong your team is, you are certain to win a lot of contests, so you had
better sit down now and check that everybody will receive the same fair
distribution of winnings.

You will participate in multiple contests, and at the end of each one receive
a set amount of prize money. You can distribute any amount to each of the three
members of your team each time, but by the end everyone must have the same
amount of total winnings.

end?
