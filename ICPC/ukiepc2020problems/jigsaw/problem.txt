Jigsaw


You have found an old jigsaw puzzle in the attic of your house, left behind by
the previous occupants. Because you like puzzles, you decide to put this one
together. But before you start, you want to know whether this puzzle was left
behind for a reason. Maybe it is incomplete? Maybe the box contains pieces from
multiple puzzles? 

If it looks like a complete puzzle, you also need to know how big your work
surface needs to be. Nothing worse than having to start a jigsaw over because
you started on a small table.

The box does not tell you the dimensions  of the puzzle, but you can
quickly count the three types of pieces in the box:
itemize
	
		Corner pieces, which touch two of the edges of the puzzle.
	
		Edge pieces, which touch one of the edges of the puzzle.
	
		Centre pieces, which touch none of the edges of the puzzle.
itemize

Do these pieces add up to a complete jigsaw puzzle? If so, what was the original
size of the jigsaw puzzle?


Input
	itemize
		
			One line containing three integers , , and 
			(), the number of corner pieces,
			edge pieces, and centre pieces respectively.
	itemize

Output
	If there exist numbers  and  satisfying  such that the original size of
	the jigsaw puzzle could have been , then output a single
	line containing  and .
	Otherwise, output ``impossible''.

	If there are multiple valid solutions, you may output any one of them.
