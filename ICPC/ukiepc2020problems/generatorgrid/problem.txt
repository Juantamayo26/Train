The volcanic island of Fleeland has never had a proper electric net, but finally the administration of the island
have agreed to build the island's power plants and network.

On the island's coast are its  cities. The administration has surveyed the cities and proposed  of them as possible
locations for a power plant, with the th proposal stating that the company can build a plant in city  for
cost .

These power plants are very modern and a single plant could power the whole island, but the volcano makes building
power lines across the island a dangerous affair. For , the company can build power lines between
cities  and  for a cost of , and between cities  and  for a cost of .
A city will receive power if it contains a power plant or is connected to a city with a power plant via power
lines.

What is the cheapest way to power all the cities on the island?

Input
	
		One line containing two integers  () and  (), the
			number of cities and the number of possible locations for a power plant.
		Then follow  lines, the th of which contains  () and  (
), the th possible location for a power plant, and the cost to build it.

		Then follows a line containing  integers  (), the costs of
			building the power lines.
	
  The values of  are unique and given in strictly increasing order.

Output
	Output the minimal cost of powering all cities on the island.
